Installation
-----------------
By default CodeMirror library is loaded from CDN. If you prefer to install it
locally download and unpack the library to the libraries directory. Make sure
the path to the library becomes: libraries/codemirror. Use `drush c-m-d` command
for quick installation.
Note: because libraries/codemirror directory is web accessible it's recommended
to protect or remove unused files from it to avoid possible security risks.
