The CSO is complemented by a standard cancer type coding scheme. Together, these tools lay a framework to improve coordination among research organizations, making it possible to compare and contrast the research portfolios of public, non-profit, and governmental research agencies. In the section below, you can browse the CSO and see examples of research in each area. Links to the CSO in other languages, and training guides are provided in the download area. The current version (v2) of the CSO was adopted by the International Cancer Research Partnership in April 2015 and all awards in the database are coded to this version.

The CSO is complemented by a standard cancer type coding scheme. Together, these tools lay a framework to improve coordination among research organizations, making it possible to compare and contrast the research portfolios of public, non-profit, and governmental research agencies. In the section below, you can browse the CSO and see examples of research in each area. Links to the CSO in other languages, and training guides are provided in the download area. The current version (v2) of the CSO was adopted by the International Cancer Research Partnership in April 2015 and all awards in the database are coded to this version.
