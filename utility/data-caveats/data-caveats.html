      <td>Dollar amounts found in the ICRP database are different than what is reported in the American Cancer Society\'s Annual Report. This is because the annual report has been audited. The dollar amounts spent on research reported in this document includes operating expenses of the Research Department. Additionally, the dollar amounts also exclude all grants that were cancelled after being awarded, but includes money that was returned from grants cancelled in the current year that were awarded in previous years. The dollar amounts reported in the database are unaudited and include grants awarded each fiscal year, exclusive of grants that cancelled before activation.</td>

Grants to the University of California receive only direct funds, while grants to other institutions also receive indirect costs (overhead) at 25% or the federally negotiated rate. Collaborative awards are counted in graphs and tables by the number of co-Principal Investigators rather than the number of projects.</td>

      <td>Dollar amounts found in the ICRP database are different than what is reported on Komen\'s website or in Komen\'s Annual Report for the following reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>Komen commits all funds necessary to support a research grant in the year it is awarded. Therefore, Komen\'s website reports on the full amount of each grant in the year it is initiated, while the ICRP data is annualized, as described.</li>
          <li>Komen funds research grants to our Scientific Advisors (Scientific Advisory Board members and Komen Scholars) and also provides discretionary funding of research-related projects that are not traditional research grants (e.g. support of the Komen Tissue Bank, ASCO and AACR meeting support). These are included in the overall Research Program spending, as reported in our Annual Report and on our website, but are not included in the ICRP database.</li>

            NIH projects in NIH Reporter assigned to the Spend Category ‘cancer’ are included in the ICRP database from FY2005 onwards. A small number of projects are excluded if essential information is missing (primarily Project title, Institution). Previous years’ data were drawn from the NFRP and may be incomplete.
          </li>

          <li>
            Starting in FY2007 NCI reports funding supplements, etc., for each grant separately instead of including them in the main project, therefore the number of projects may differ significantly from those of previous years.
          </li>

          <li>
            Projects with a cost of $0 include those that were a no-cost extension of the grant or when funding was provided by another NIH institute or center for that FY.
          </li>

          <li>
            NCI dollars in the ICRP database are drawn from NIH reporter and may not match dollars from other NCI-only databases.

      <td class="partnerName">Worldwide Cancer Research</td>
      <td>
        Worldwide Cancer Research is unique in that the majority of our funding is awarded to researchers in countries outside the UK. Like many UK research charities, Worldwide Cancer Research only funds the direct costs of research. This creates significant problems in making quantitative comparisons between our funding and that provided by some of the other agencies in the ICRP, which fund both the direct and indirect costs (often called overheads) of research.

Firstly, there is variance due to different reporting periods (1 April snapshot of ICRP versus full financial year reporting by DH). Secondly, the Department\'s National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) encompasses various expenditure on NHS infrastructure for research relevant to cancer that is not in a format that it is possible to capture for ICRP.</td>
