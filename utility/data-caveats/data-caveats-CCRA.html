<h1>ICRP Data Caveats - CCRA Organizations</h1>

<div id="content">
  <h3>General data caveats</h3>

  <p>Caveats/limitations of the Canadian Cancer Research Survey (CCRS) as documented in CCRA reports are applicable and will not be repeated here. Please consult the available publications at the CCRA web site: <a href="http://www.ccra-acrc.ca/aboutus_publications_en.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ccra-acrc.ca/aboutus_publications_en.htm</a>. This document describes caveats specific to the subset of CCRS data provided to the ICRP.<br />
    <br />
    Data reported by CCRA will vary from the ICRP data as follows:</p>

      <tr>
        <td>Not all CCRS participating organizations are included in the ICRP.</td>
        <td>For the period 2005-2007, CCRA submitted data to the ICRP for 18 organizations and the three multi-funded initiatives (CBCRA, CPCRI, and CTCRI). This data represents ~30% of the investment documented/reported by the CCRS. We will address this issue, in part, with the 2008 data year submission as we will open data submission to all CCRS participating organizations.</td>
        <td>Major for 2005-2007; medium impact expected from 2008 on.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Not all CCRS projects are (will be) included in the ICRP.</td>
        <td>Even with all organizations included, some discrepancies will remain. Specifically, "related support" grants (i.e., travel awards, workshops/symposia, LOIs, etc.) and equipment/infrastructure grants that have a cancer relevance weighting of less than 100% are not reported to the ICRP, but are included in reports released by CCRA.</td>
        <td>Medium overall; major impact expected for some organizations (e.g., CFI).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ICRP uses a different approach to calculating annual project investment.</td>
        <td>CCRA provides ICRP with the full project amount and start and end dates. A pro-rated calculation is used to derive annual investment. CCRA bases its prorated calculations on annual project amounts (where those data are available) to account for differences in dollar flow.</td>
        <td>Minor</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ICRP uses different site coding conventions.</td>
        <td>The cancer site/type codes used within the CCRS are different from ICRP site codes so results by site will vary in some instances.</td>
        <td>Minor</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ICRP has technical limitations.</td>
        <td>ICRP has a technical limit of 12 site codes and 8 CSO codes and this requires truncation for a couple of large-scale projects within the CCRS.</td>
        <td>Very minor</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CCRA provides less descriptive information about its projects to ICRP.</td>
        <td>Lay abstracts are submitted by CCRA to the ICRP in lieu of scientific abstracts and in their language of origin. For projects without lay abstracts (and there are a significant number of these), only titles are provided. An English translation is provided alongside all French project titles to facilitate use of the search engine.</td>
        <td>No impact on investment figures, but limits full functionality of search engine especially for organizations that do not collect/report lay abstracts.</td>
