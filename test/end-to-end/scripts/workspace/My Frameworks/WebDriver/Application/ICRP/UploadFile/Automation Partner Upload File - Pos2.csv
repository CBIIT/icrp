Leidos1_12-4	7/1/2017	6/30/2019		Leidos1_12f-4	Metabolic reprogramming mediates radiation-induced dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells into cancer stem cells	Parent	R	n	7/1/2017	6/30/2019	"5.1,1.2"	"50,50"	7	100	200000	n		Junior Faculty Award (JFA)	ASTRO				Vlashi	Erina	"The Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles"	Los Angeles	CA	US	90095-6951	University of California Los Angeles				"Not all breast cancer (BC) cells are created equal. Within each tumor a hierarchy exists that puts a small population of breast cancer initiating (or stem/progenitor) cells (BCICs) at the apex according to their ability to initiate and propagate the tumor, cause systemic spread and exhibit exquisite resistance to treatment. Elimination of BCICs is a moving target as BC cells can move within this hierarchy through phenotype reprogramming. In fact, the concept of inducible BCIC (iBCIC) was recently introduced based on the observation that ionizing radiation (IR) drives surviving BC cells to reprogram into treatment-resistant iBCIC and ultimately treatment failure. BCICs reside in a distinct metabolic state when compared to the non-initiating BC cells. The metabolic requirements of the IR-induced BCIC and the metabolic changes necessary for successful IR-induced reprogramming are not known. The aim in this proposal is to elucidate the metabolic-stemness loop that seems to be fueled by radiation treatment, with the goal of identifying druggable targets and interfere with IR-induced reprogramming events and improve the efficacy of radiation therapy.
More specifically, IR-induced reprogramming of BC cells into BCICs involves the re-expression of the developmental transcription factor OCT3/4 and KLF4 amongst others, which play a crucial role in the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Also, there is a remarkable link between these early developmental, stem-cell specific transcription factors and key metabolic enzymes. Namely, KLF4 can activate the transcription of the first rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme PFK1, resulting in an increase in glycolytic flux that appears to be crucial of IR-induced reprogramming into BCIC. Another key glycolytic enzyme, PKM2 can translocate to the nucleus in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner where it facilitates the transcription of OCT3/4. In fact, this KL4-PFK1/PKM2-OCT3/4 axis is activated in irradiated breast cancer cells, potentially explaining how IR drives the iBCIC phenotype. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand how early IR-induced changes in the metabolic state of surviving BC cells determine their response to subsequent exposure to IR. "	"Breast cancer cells exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity not only on their ability to initiate and propagate a breast tumor, but also on their metabolic phenotype. Such heterogeneity is compounded by the discovery that radiation therapy can reprogram the metabolic phenotype of surviving cells, a process that seems to promote radiation-induced reprogramming of breast cancer cells into breast cancer initiating cells, which are resistant to current treatments. This proposal explores the role of glycolytic metabolism, specifically the role of rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes PFK1 and PKM2, in the radiation-induced reprogramming of BC cells, with the goal of preventing radiation-induced reprogramming from occurring and improving the efficacy of radiation therapy in breast cancer."

However, many disease sites limit the feasibility of these radiation modalities due to considerable toxicity conferred by large radiation fields based on anatomic location and/or clinicopathologic extent of disease. Recent research into radiobiological differences between conventional and ablative dose radiation dictates that dose escalation works beyond augmentation of DNA damage to involve a number of tumor microenvironment regulators (TME). Key components in the dose escalation response and TME are microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs in the genome that typically downregulate the expression of a number of protein coding genes. As the tumor vasculature is a key component of the TME, we directed attention to acid sphingomyelinase, or sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (SMPD1), which has been extensively characterized in facilitating rapid endothelial apoptosis after ablative doses of radiation. Recent work in our lab has revealed that the magnitude of radiation dose elicits distinct miRNA expression profiles. Among miRNAs which target SMPD1, miR-15a expressed the greatest magnitude difference between standard and ablative dose radiation with substantially lower miR-15a levels at higher doses. Initial mechanistic studies have demonstrated inhibition of miR-15a using exogenous miR-15a inhibitor resembles cellular damage observed at ablative doses of radiation. In this context, we hypothesize inhibition of miR-15a will enhance radiation-induced endothelial apoptosis via preservation of SMPD1. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) ascertain the functional mechanism by which miR-15a regulates SMPD1 and radiosensitivity in endothelial cells and 2) characterize the effects of vascular targeted in vivo delivery of miR-15a inhibitor on radiation inducible SMPD1-mediated apoptosis. Through methodical dissection of the miR-15a pathway, our long-term derivation of these day is to identify regulatory nodes amenable to modulation by pre-existing therapeutic agents or facilitate formulation of alternative therapies to enhance treatment of disease sites limited to lower dose radiation.  "	"In recent years, safer delivery of higher doses of toxic radiation to cancer has been achieved by advancements in treatment techniques in the form of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). However, certain disease sites do not permit these modalities due to extent of radiation coverage needed for optimal disease control and corresponding increased risk of damage to closely adjacent critical organs unaffected by cancer. The molecular response of cancer cells to escalating doses of radiation has revealed higher doses of radiation works beyond DNA damage and activates responses among the vasculature, immune cells, and architectural stromal cells adjacent to cancer cells collectively known as the tumor microenvironment (TME). A common regulatory element in the TME and radiation response are microRNA’s, which are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit the expression of a number of functionally related protein coding genes. With a focus on the vasculature, we focused our attention on acid sphingomyelinase, or sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (SMPD1), which has been shown to enhance endothelial cell death via apoptosis. However, this phenomenon is observed only after administering higher doses of radiation. Recent work in our lab has revealed that the magnitude of radiation dose elicits distinct miRNA expression profiles. Among miRNAs which target SMPD1, miR-15a expressed the greatest magnitude difference between standard and ablative dose radiation with substantially lower miR-15a levels at higher doses.

Leidos1_12f_2	7/1/2017	6/30/2018		Leidos1_12f_2	The role of miR-34 in the DNA damage response and cancer cell immune evasion via regulation of PD-L1 after ionizing radiation	Parent	R	n	7/1/2017	6/30/2018	"5.1,1.4"	"50,50"	2	100	25000	n		Residents/Fellows in Radiation Oncology Seed Grant	ASTRO				Yuan	Ye	"The Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles"	Los Angeles	CA	US	90095-9651	University of California Los Angeles				"Radiation can kill cancer cells through DNA damage and by eliciting an intratumoral immune response. However, cancer cells can bypass these effects through upregulating DNA repair pathways and through expression of programmed death ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) to evade the immune system. MicroRNA-34 (miR-34) has been shown to exist in an inactive form in some cancer cells and is rapidly activated after radiation. Furthermore, PD-L1 harbors a putative miR-34 binding site indicating that it may be downregulated when miR-34 is activated by radiation. The goal of this proposal is to determine if miR-34 modulates the radiosensitivity of cancer cells and regulates cancer immune evasion via PD-L1 following radiation.   "	"Radiation kills cancer by damaging the DNA of cancer cells and causing an immune reaction within tumors. However, cancer cells can adapt by repairing areas of DNA damage and by expressing a protein called PD-L1 that can help them evade the immune system. We have found that a small RNA called microRNA-34, which is involved in DNA repair, is activated in some cancer cells shortly after radiation. There is also evidence that microRNA-34 can decrease the expression of PD-L1. Our goal is to determine if activation of microRNA-34 alters the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation while simultaneously making cancer cells less able to evade the immune system.   "						
Leidos1_12f_3	7/1/2017	6/30/2018		Leidos1_12f_3	Investigating the immunomodulatory effects of radiation with and without immune checkpoint inhibition in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck	Parent	R	n	7/1/2017	6/30/2018	"5.1,5.3,4.1,1.4"	"25,25,25,25"	"36,21"	"50,50"	25000	n		Residents/Fellows in Radiation Oncology Seed Grant	ASTRO				Mitra	Devarati	Dana-Farber Cancer Institute	Boston	MA	US	2115	Dana Farber Cancer Institute				"It has long been known that cancer progression depends on evading immune surveillance. In the last 6-7 years, immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized oncology by showing impressive, durable treatment responses in a subset of patients with a variety of advanced malignancies, including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (H&N). The purpose of the proposed studies is to investigate how hypofractionated radiation may alter the immune milieu in H&N cancer by stimulating tumor antigen specific immune responses and whether this radiation-induced anti-tumor immunity could improve the response to immune checkpoint inhibition. 

To achieve this goal, I will pursue a bench-to-bedside approach, studying the immune milieu of mouse models of carcinogen-induced oral cancer with defined endogenous tumor specific antigens as well as of patients with advanced H&N cancer enrolled on two clinical trials of hypofractionated radiation. It is hypothesized that radiation will improve head and neck cancer-specific immune responses in both the patient samples and mouse models. It is also expected that hypofractionated radiation will more favorably impact T-cell specific responses and activation as compared to our previous data collected describing the immunologic effects of conventionally fractionated radiation. Thus, the studies currently proposed will investigate how radiation modulates the immune system both alone and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition with the goal of determining how to combine treatment modalities for maximal efficacy.

For the patient studies, I will attempt to identify head and neck cancer-specific immune responses and examine stimulatory and inhibitory T-cell populations before and after hypofractionated radiation in the absence and presence of pembrolizumab. For the mouse studies, I will administer hypofractionated radiation with and without checkpoint inhibition to 3 mouse oral cancer (MOC) models with variable baseline immunogenicity and responsiveness to PD-1 inhibition. Using these animals, which mimic the diversity of response to checkpoint inhibition seen in patients, I will analyze the impact of radiation on tumor-specific immune responses and T-cell activation . 

Overall, by combining patient data and animal models I hope to illustrate that immune endpoints are relevant to ultimate disease outcomes and can be used to optimize the design of future clinical trials. In addition I hope these studies will inform how best to combine radiation and immunotherapy in the context of individualized tumor micro-environment features, with the goal of optimizing response rates.     "	"Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. While patients with early stage disease are often cured with a combination of radiation, surgery and chemotherapy, more advanced disease, particularly in the context of tobacco use, is associated with high rates of disease recurrence and death. Patients with advanced head and neck cancer need new treatment options. 

The immune system is known to play an important role in surveillance of “foreign” material in the body including infectious agents and cancer cells. For years, investigators have sought to harness the power of the immune system to attack tumor cells, but the last decade has provided revolutionary new insight. The driving force of this advance is a new class of drug called immune checkpoint inhibitors that take the brakes off the immune system and allow improved recognition of cancer cells. These drugs have shown impressive, long-lasting efficacy in controlling a wide variety of advanced malignancies, including cancers of the head and neck. Unfortunately, most patients do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors alone. A recent large study of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer found that nivolumab significantly improved overall survival but had only a 13% response rate.

In parallel, the last decade has demonstrated the power of more traditional therapeutic modalities, such as radiation therapy, to have profound effects on the ability of the immune system to successfully fight cancer. Shorter radiation treatment courses that deliver high doses of radiation per treatment, known as hypofractionated radiation, seem to be particularly effective at activating the local tumor immune environment. 

The goal of the proposed studies is to investigate how hypofractionated radiation, either alone or in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibition, alters tumor specific immune responses in head and neck cancer in patients and in 3 parallel mouse models of carcinogen-associated oral cancer that have known variable response to immune checkpoint inhibition. By characterizing the immunologic effects and disease progression of head and neck patients enrolled on early-phase prospective clinical trials in parallel with this spectrum of mouse models I will be able to pursue a truly bench-to-bedside approach. Ultimately, I hope to help illustrate that immune endpoints are relevant to disease outcomes and can be used to optimize the design of future clinical trials. In addition, I hope these studies will inform how best to combine radiation and immunotherapy with the goal of maximizing long-term disease response.    "			0000-0002-2225-164X
