<div class="well bg-grey">
<h4>Being a Partner</h4>

<p>With ICRP support, Partners submit research portfolio funding data to the database regularly. Awards on the ICRP database are coded using a <a href="/cso" style="font-weight:bold">common classification system</a> organized into six broad areas of scientific interest in cancer research complemented by a standard cancer type coding scheme. ICRP can offer coding for new partners and access to automated coding methodologies.</p>

<p>Partners are asked to nominate specific point(s) of contact to participate in our meetings. Our monthly teleconferences are organized on a rotation to ensure that partners in different time zones can participate regularly.</p>

<p>Partners are asked to adhere to our <a href="/sites/default/files/downloads/ICRP_PoliciesProcedures.pdf" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank">Policies and Procedures</a> in accordance with our co-operative and collaborative ways of working.</p>

<p>Costs: Annual membership fees contribute to ICRP’s running costs and provision of resources. Costs are tiered according to the size of the partner organization and range from $500 to $25,000 per annum. Further details are included in our <a href="/sites/default/files/downloads/ICRPNewMembersGuide.pdf" style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank">Partnership Guide</a>.</p>
